Backstory: The year is 3025, America has finally regained its former glory after years of cruel rule under supreme ruler Donald J. Trump. Trump’s plan to build a wall to stop Latino immigration into the country was successful, but in doing so, caused the whole economy to fall apart, throwing America into yet another Great depression again. After several years of conflict, Trump was shut down from being president after ingesting too much of mom’s spaghetti. Years into the future, a group of scientists whom had dedicated their lives to Trump, revived him from the dead and gave him a new life. 
With his new life a new group of morons flocked to his side. The first supporter is an old racist man who believes all immigrants should die, next there is an obese biker who likes everything as loud and obnoxious as he is. Also a woman who was suffering from the stupid decided to grab her child and follow trump along with the devil who plots to reduce the world to rubble. Both Hitler and Kim Jong-un who were former leaders who wanted mass destruction were revitalized to guide trump in his attacks. Finally the most dangerous of all the supporters an Oompa Loompa was tempted by Trumps orangey looks reminding him of his mother’s tangerine glow.
